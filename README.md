## 2022 r/Fantasy Bingo Card Recommendations

Using the database created by [u/lost_chayote](https://www.reddit.com/user/lost_chayote/) I made the bingo card interactive to see the various recommendations made by the community. The database is seeded with a csv file downloaded from [u/lost_chayote's google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w1i9a9xlLkoxaBfR1jDP9ecPQTqWelpavDN4KHkUahA/edit#gid=0). 

Currently, the database is fixed and not able to be updated with additional recommendations without reseeding. I built this fairly quickly so if there is enough demand I can work to include submissions.

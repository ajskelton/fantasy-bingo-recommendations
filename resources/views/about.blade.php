            <p>This application is an interactive experience for viewing the list of recommended books to complete the various squares in r/fantasy's 2022
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/bingo">Bingo Card</a>. The recommendations were put together by Reddit user
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lost_chayote/">u/lost_chayote</a> who scraped the various Bingo recommendation threads and compiled the list. The list is all from user input so it might not always be perfect or accurate. But it's just a tool to help people find books for the various bingo squares.</p>
            <p>See the original thread about the database <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/u4y4yw/resource_unofficial_database_for_2022_rfantasy/">here</a>.</p>
            <p>View the <a href="https://github.com/ajskelton/fantasy-bingo-recommendations">Github Repo</a> and submit any issues or bugs you encounter. There is no option for submitting additional books at this time. I built the app quickly as practice as well as an easier view of the database.</p>
